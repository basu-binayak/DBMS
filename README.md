## Introduction to DBMS
Any enterprise or entity that has the requirement of a collection of interrelated data, a set of programs to access the data and also needs an environment that is both convenient and easy to use, will require a Database Management System or DBMS. Thus, almost every industry uses DBMS in some capacity to manage and store data.<br>
